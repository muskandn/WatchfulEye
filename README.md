A CCTV-based  Violence Detection System .
With the increasing prevalence of surveillance cameras in modern cities, the human resources available for real-time monitoring of these screens are insufficient. By Merging computer vision and machine learning algorithms, we have successfully developed a system capable of real-time detection and identification of violent incidents in monitored areas.
Our user-friendly interface empowers security personnel to monitor live feeds, review notifications , and take necessary actions, thereby creating an active approach to violence detection.
We have built and implemented an automated system which can be integrated with the CCTV Systems and an appropriate notification will be sent to concerned authorities. 
The detection is done with the assistance of an ML Model implemented in TFLite, for lightweight and fast execution.This Model was trained on [RWF2000 Dataset](https://github.com/mchengny/RWF2000-Video-Database-for-Violence-Detection)  Dataset which is a collection of nearly 2000 video clips as a new data set for real-world violent behavior detection under surveillance camera.

### There are two parts of of this project:

#### 1) The implementation of an example System code in Python (in the `SystemCode` directory) :-
