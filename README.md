## WatchfulEye

A CCTV-based  Violence Detection System .
With the increasing prevalence of surveillance cameras in modern cities, the human resources available for real-time monitoring of these screens are insufficient. By Merging computer vision and machine learning algorithms, we have successfully developed a system capable of real-time detection and identification of violent incidents in monitored areas.
Our user-friendly interface empowers security personnel to monitor live feeds, review notifications , and take necessary actions, thereby creating an active approach to violence detection.
